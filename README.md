How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

To ensure functionality, I conduct comprehensive unit, integration, system, and regression testing using frameworks like JUnit in the case of the Contact Service in this repository. For security, I can perform code reviews, penetration testing, and implement strong authentication, authorization, and encryption practices while keeping dependencies up to date.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I interpret user needs by conducting stakeholder interviews, surveys, and creating user stories. In the case of this repository, these user needs were given in the form of assignment requirements.  I incorporate these needs through prioritization, feasibility studies, and iterative design using wireframes, prototypes, and agile development methodologies. Fully understanding the customer or user requirements is essential to building a program that is successful in the eyes of the customer.

How do I approach designing software?

I start with understanding the requirements and defining the high-level architecture and key components. Using UML diagrams and planning out based on requirements is important to me as I require a visual understanding of the project, understanding it modularly before I begin coding. I use best practices such as SOLID principles, design patterns, and thorough documentation, and follow an iterative development process to refine the design based on feedback.
